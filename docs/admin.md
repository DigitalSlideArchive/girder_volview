# Server administration

## Speedup S3 file downloading by disabling proxying

The VolView plugin proxies request to download files from S3 by default.
This avoids a CORS error when loading a file from an S3 bucket asset store without CORS configuration.
To speed up downloading of files from S3, the Girder admin can:

1. [Configure CORS](https://girder.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide.html#s3) in the S3 bucket for the Girder server.
2. Change the global [Girder configuration](https://girder.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html) to add
   a `[volview]` section with a `proxy_assetstores = False` option. See below:

```
[volview]
# Workaround CORS configuration errors in S3 assetstores.
# If True, the Girder server will proxy file download requests from
# VolView clients to the S3 assetstore. This will use more server bandwidth.
# If False, VolView client requests to download files are redirected to S3.
# Defaults to True.
proxy_assetstores = False
```
